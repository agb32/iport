To get working on darc@canary:
modprobe myri10ge

I think this is now loaded by default - put an entry in
/etc/modules-load.d
However, systemctl status systemd-modules-load.service isn't too
convincing!

dmesg - reported that the new interface (the 10G card) was p1p1

system-config-network
Added p1p1 as 192.168.1.1

ifup p1p1

Then hopefully, arv-tool will find it...


Setting ocam parameters via the iport - use
DeviceSerialPort_ebus/iportSerial.py for a python module that sets via
darc, or use iportSerialWrite when darc isn't running.
